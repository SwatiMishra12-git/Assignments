        "Random sampling is a fundamental technique in statistics used to make inferences about a population based on a smaller, manageable subset of that population. The goal is to obtain a sample that accurately represents the broader population, enabling researchers to draw conclusions with a known level of confidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Importance of Random Sampling\n",
        "1. **Representation:** Random sampling ensures that every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. This helps in creating a sample that is representative of the entire population, reducing bias and improving the validity of the inferences.\n",
        "2. **Generalization:** By analyzing a randomly selected sample, researchers can generalize their findings to the larger population. This is crucial in studies where surveying the entire population is impractical due to time, cost, or logistical constraints.\n",
        "3. **Reliability:** Random sampling enhances the reliability and credibility of statistical results. It minimizes the risk of overestimating or underestimating population parameters, leading to more accurate and trustworthy conclusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Types of Random Sampling\n",
        "1. **Simple Random Sampling:** Each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. This can be done using random number generators or drawing lots.\n",
        "   - **Example:** Drawing names from a hat to select participants for a survey.\n",
        "2. **Stratified Random Sampling:** The population is divided into subgroups (strata) based on certain characteristics (e.g., age, gender). A random sample is then drawn from each stratum.\n",
        "   - **Example:** Surveying students by randomly selecting equal numbers of boys and girls from each grade level.\n",
        "3. **Systematic Random Sampling:** A starting point is randomly selected, and then every \\(n\\)th member of the population is chosen.\n",
        "   - **Example:** Selecting every 10th person from a list of customers for feedback.\n",
        "4. **Cluster Sampling:** The population is divided into clusters, and entire clusters are randomly selected. This method is useful when the population is spread over a large area.\n",
        "   - **Example:** Randomly selecting a few schools from a district and surveying all students in those schools.\n",

        "Random sampling allows researchers to make inferences about population parameters (e.g., mean, proportion) based on sample statistics. Here’s how it works:\n",
        "1. **Point Estimation:** Using sample data to estimate population parameters. For example, the sample mean can estimate the population mean.\n",
        "2. **Confidence Intervals:** Providing a range of values within which the population parameter is likely to fall. Confidence intervals account for sampling variability and give an estimate of precision.\n",

        "   - Skewness affects the choice of statistical measures and tests. For example, in skewed data, the median is often a better measure of central tendency than the mean.\n",

        "The **normal distribution** (or Gaussian distribution) is one of the most important probability distributions in statistics. It is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric and bell-shaped, and it describes how the values of a variable are distributed.\n",

        "Here are the key properties of the normal distribution:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Symmetry:**\n",
        "   - The normal distribution is symmetric about its mean. This means the left half is a mirror image of the right half.\n",
        "   - The mean, median, and mode of the distribution are all equal and located at the center of the distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Bell-Shaped Curve:**\n",
        "   - The distribution forms a bell-shaped curve.\n",
        "   - The tails of the distribution approach the horizontal axis asymptotically, meaning they get closer and closer to the axis but never actually touch it.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Mean and Standard Deviation:**\n",
        "   - The shape of the normal distribution is defined by two parameters: the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ).\n",
        "   - The mean determines the center of the distribution, while the standard deviation controls the spread or width of the distribution.\n",

        "- **Covariance (17.5):** A positive covariance indicates that as the number of hours studied increases, exam scores also tend to increase.\n",
